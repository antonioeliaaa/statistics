      <h2>What is Statistics, and Why is it Useful for Cybersecurity?</h2>
      <p>
        Statistics is, at its core, a way of making sense of the world through numbers. It’s not just formulas on a board — it’s a method to collect data, organize it, and read it in a way that tells a clear story. It has two main sides: descriptive statistics, which summarizes what’s happening (like the daily average of login attempts), and inferential statistics, which uses what we already know to make predictions and better understand what might come next.

In cybersecurity, this approach is essential. Every system generates huge amounts of data: access logs, network flows, login attempts, alerts. Without a way to interpret all that noise, it’s just background chatter. With statistics, those random numbers become meaningful signals.

Picture this: you manage a website. One day, you check your logs and notice a 150% spike in SSH login attempts coming from the same region. Without historical data, it might seem like just “a busy day.” But with statistical analysis, you can compare today’s numbers to your usual baseline and realize something’s off. What was just a hunch becomes a real anomaly — and you can act before it’s too late.

Statistics also helps assess risks and make smarter decisions. By analyzing past incidents, you can estimate the likelihood of different kinds of attacks and figure out where to invest your resources: strengthening a specific defense, fixing a vulnerability, or improving monitoring.

And it doesn’t stop there. Predictive models can help spot warning signs of future problems, like patterns that often appear before a DDoS attack. After an incident, statistics makes it possible to piece events together — connecting suspicious emails, logins, and data movements into a clear picture of what happened.

Of course, none of this works without good data. If your logs are incomplete or biased, the conclusions can be misleading. And statistical models need to evolve, because cyber threats change constantly.

In the end, statistics isn’t just an academic subject — it’s a practical tool to read reality with clarity. In cybersecurity, it means moving from gut reactions to structured defenses. It’s the difference between sailing without a map and having a reliable compass in your hand.
