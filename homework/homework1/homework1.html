      <h2>What is Statistics, and Why is it Useful for Cybersecurity?</h2>
      <p>
        Statistics in the context of cybersecurity is a critical technical tool for detecting, analyzing, and preventing incidents. It works on two main levels: descriptive statistics and inferential statistics. Descriptive statistics summarize collected data through averages, percentages, standard deviations, and frequency distributions, creating an operational baseline that reflects normal system behavior. Inferential statistics use probabilistic models to estimate deviations from that baseline and detect anomalies with measurable significance. In this way, raw data are transformed into meaningful security signals.

      <p>
        In a corporate environment, a sudden increase of 200 percent over usual activity represents a statistically significant deviation and can be classified with high confidence as a potential brute force attack.
      </p>
   
      <p>
        When UDP normally accounts for only a small portion of overall network flow, a sudden spike strongly suggests suspicious activity such as data exfiltration or the early stage of a DDoS attack. These anomalies often appear minutes before a service disruption, providing valuable time to respond.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Corporate email traffic tends to follow predictable patterns. A sharp rise in messages from unknown domains within a short time window is a strong indicator of a targeted phishing campaign.
      </p>
     
      <p>
        An account transferring far more data than usual or an IoT sensor suddenly sending dramatically more messages generates deviations that are difficult to explain through normal variation and often point to a compromise.
      </p>
    
      <p>
        These scenarios show that statistics is not a theoretical framework but a precise operational instrument. Establishing reliable baselines, setting clear thresholds, and analyzing deviations make it possible to distinguish normal fluctuations from real security incidents. In complex environments with millions of daily events, this approach reduces false positives and enables earlier detection of threats. Statistics do not replace firewalls or IDS systems; they make them smarter. They turn logs into signals, signals into indicators, and indicators into action. In this transformation from quantity to quality lies much of the effectiveness of modern cybersecurity.
