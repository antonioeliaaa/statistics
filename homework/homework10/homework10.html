      <h2>1. Context and Goal</h2>
      <p>
        This homework is conceptually connected to two previous activities:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>the simulation of a <strong>Bernoulli process</strong> and the Law of Large Numbers (LLN),</li>
        <li>the simulation of a <strong>server security random walk</strong> (Homework 7), where weekly outcomes are
          \((+1)\) for secure and \((-1)\) for breached weeks.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The aim of this homework is to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>discuss analogies and differences between the simple Bernoulli LLN simulation and the server random walk,</li>
        <li>highlight how both are based on the same probabilistic structure,</li>
        <li>illustrate the relationships with <strong>binomial coefficients</strong>, <strong>Pascal’s triangle</strong>,
          <strong>binomial expansion</strong>, the <strong>Fibonacci sequence</strong> and related
          <strong>combinatorial coefficients</strong>.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>2. Bernoulli Process and Law of Large Numbers</h2>
      <p>
        In the LLN homework, we considered a sequence of independent Bernoulli trials:
      </p>
      <p>\[
        Y_1, Y_2, \dots, Y_n,\quad Y_i \sim \text{Bernoulli}(p),
      \]</p>
      <p>
        where each trial represents a <em>success</em> (1) with probability \(p\) and a <em>failure</em> (0) with
        probability \(1-p\).
      </p>
      <p>
        The cumulative number of successes after \(n\) trials is:
      </p>
      <p>\[
        B_n = \sum_{i=1}^n Y_i,
      \]</p>
      <p>
        and the sample mean is:
      </p>
      <p>\[
        \bar{Y}_n = \frac{B_n}{n}.
      \]</p>
      <p>
        The <strong>Law of Large Numbers</strong> states that:
      </p>
      <p>\[
        \bar{Y}_n \xrightarrow[n \to \infty]{} p
      \]</p>
      <p>
        i.e. the empirical frequency of successes converges to the true probability \(p\) as the number of trials grows.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Server Random Walk (Homework 7) as a Bernoulli Process</h2>
      <p>
        In Homework 7, we modelled the weekly status of a server under attack. For each week \(i\) we defined a random
        variable:
      </p>
      <p>\[
        X_i =
        \begin{cases}
          +1, & \text{if the server remains secure in week } i, \\
          -1, & \text{if the server is breached in week } i.
        \end{cases}
      \]</p>
      <p>
        Assuming independence between weeks, we have:
      </p>
      <p>\[
        \mathbb{P}(X_i = -1) = q, \quad \mathbb{P}(X_i = +1) = 1 - q,
      \]</p>
      <p>
        where the effective weekly breach probability is:
      </p>
      <p>\[
        q = 1 - (1 - p)^m,
      \]</p>
      <p>
        with \(p\) the breach probability of a single attacker and \(m\) the number of attackers.
      </p>
      <p>
        The cumulative score after \(n\) weeks is the random walk:
      </p>
      <p>\[
        S_n = \sum_{i=1}^n X_i.
      \]</p>
      <p>
        Let \(B_n\) be the number of breached weeks (i.e. the number of times \(X_i = -1\)) over \(n\) weeks. Then:
      </p>
      <p>\[
        B_n \sim \text{Binomial}(n, q), \qquad
        S_n = n - 2B_n,
      \]</p>
      <p>
        so the random walk is just a transformed Binomial variable. The LLN appears again in the limit:
      </p>
      <p>\[
        \frac{S_n}{n} = \frac{n - 2B_n}{n} = 1 - 2\frac{B_n}{n}
        \xrightarrow[n \to \infty]{} 1 - 2q
      \]</p>
      <p>
        because \( \tfrac{B_n}{n} \to q \) by the LLN for Bernoulli trials.
      </p>

      <h2>4. Analogies Between the Two Simulations</h2>
      <p>
        Both the Bernoulli LLN experiment and the server random walk are built on the same core ingredients:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>a sequence of independent Bernoulli trials,</li>
        <li>a Binomial distribution obtained by summing these trials,</li>
        <li>an empirical quantity (mean or normalized sum) that converges to a deterministic limit.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In both cases:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>each trial/week is a <strong>binary event</strong> (success/failure or secure/breached),</li>
        <li>the sum of trials follows a <strong>Binomial distribution</strong>,</li>
        <li>the LLN describes the convergence of empirical frequencies or normalized scores to their expectations.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>5. Differences Between the Two Simulations</h2>
      <p>
        Despite the common structure, the simulations have different interpretations and random variables. The main
        differences are summarised below.

      <h2>6. Binomial Coefficients and Pascal’s Triangle</h2>
      <h3>6.1 Binomial Coefficients</h3>
      <p>
        In both simulations, the number of successes (or breaches) in \(n\) trials is a Binomial random variable. For the
        server random walk, let \(B_n\) be the number of breached weeks:
      </p>
      <p>\[
        B_n \sim \operatorname{Binomial}(n, q),
      \]</p>
      <p>
        with probability mass function:
      </p>
      <p>\[
        \mathbb{P}(B_n = k) = \binom{n}{k} q^k (1-q)^{n-k},
        \quad k = 0, 1, \dots, n.
      \]</p>
      <p>
        The binomial coefficient
        \[
          \binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}
        \]
        counts how many sequences of length \(n\) contain exactly \(k\) breaches and \(n-k\) secure weeks. This is the
        combinatorial backbone behind:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>the histogram of the number of successes \(B_n\) in the LLN homework,</li>
        <li>the histogram of final scores \(S_n = n - 2k\) in the random walk simulation.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>6.2 Pascal’s Triangle (Tartaglia Triangle)</h3>
      <p>
        Pascal’s Triangle is a triangular array whose entries are precisely the binomial coefficients
        \(\binom{n}{k}\). Each entry is the sum of the two entries above it:
      </p>
      <p>\[
        \binom{n}{k} = \binom{n-1}{k-1} + \binom{n-1}{k},
        \quad \binom{n}{0} = \binom{n}{n} = 1.
      \]</p>
      <p>
        This recursive structure has a natural interpretation in terms of paths:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>start at the top node (0 trials),</li>
        <li>each step corresponds to adding a trial (or a week),</li>
        <li>moving “down-left” can represent a breach (or a failure), while “down-right” represents a secure week (or a success),</li>
        <li>after \(n\) steps, the number of ways to have exactly \(k\) breaches is \(\binom{n}{k}\).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Therefore, every cell in Pascal’s Triangle corresponds to the number of trajectories ending with a particular
        configuration (number of successes or breaches) in our simulations.
      </p>

      <h2>7. Binomial Expansion and Probability</h2>
      <p>
        Pascal’s Triangle also encodes the coefficients of the <strong>Binomial Theorem</strong>:
      </p>
      <p>\[
        (a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k.
      \]</p>
      <p>
        In probabilistic terms, we can choose:
      </p>
      <p>\[
        a = 1 - q \quad \text{(probability of a secure week)}, \qquad
        b = q \quad \text{(probability of a breached week)}.
      \]</p>
      <p>
        Then:
      </p>
      <p>\[
        ( (1-q) + q )^n = \sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n}{k} (1-q)^{n-k} q^k = 1.
      \]</p>
      <p>
        Each term
      </p>
      <p>\[
        \binom{n}{k} (1-q)^{n-k} q^k
      \]</p>
      <p>
        represents the probability that exactly \(k\) breaches occur in \(n\) weeks. In the LLN simulation we interpret this
        as the probability of having \(k\) successes; in the random walk we map the same term to the final score:
      </p>
      <p>\[
        S_n = n - 2k.
      \]</p>
      <p>
        Numerically, when we build histograms from simulations, we are approximating the coefficients of this binomial
        expansion via empirical frequencies.
      </p>

      <h2>8. Fibonacci Sequence and Constrained Paths</h2>
      <p>
        The combinatorial structure behind our simple \(\{0,1\}\) or \(\{-1,+1\}\) processes becomes even richer when we
        introduce <strong>constraints</strong> on the allowed paths.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>If we restrict the random walk so that it cannot go below a certain level (for example, we forbid more than one
          breach in a row, or we do not allow the cumulative score to drop below zero), the number of admissible paths up
          to step \(n\) often follows classical integer sequences.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Two important examples are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Fibonacci-like counts</strong>:
          in some models where consecutive “down steps” are forbidden, the number of valid sequences of length \(n\)
          satisfies a recurrence of the form
          \[
            F_{n} = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2},
          \]
          producing the Fibonacci sequence.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Catalan numbers</strong>:
          if we consider paths that never cross below the starting level (so-called Dyck paths), the number of valid paths
          with \(2n\) steps is given by the \(n\)-th Catalan number:
          \[
            C_n = \frac{1}{n+1}\binom{2n}{n}.
          \]
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These connections show that even extremely simple local rules (binary steps) can generate rich families of
        combinatorial objects, linking probability, number theory and discrete geometry.
      </p>

      <h2>9. Overall Conclusions</h2>
      <p>
        The Bernoulli LLN simulation and the server random walk from Homework 7 are two faces of the same underlying
        structure: a sequence of independent Bernoulli trials. Both:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>are governed by Binomial distributions,</li>
        <li>have behaviour explained by the Law of Large Numbers,</li>
        <li>are deeply linked to binomial coefficients, Pascal’s Triangle and the binomial expansion.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Moreover, when we place additional constraints on the trajectories, their counting connects to famous sequences such
        as Fibonacci and Catalan numbers. This homework therefore emphasizes that:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>simulations used in probability (LLN, random walks) are not isolated tricks,</li>
        <li>they sit inside a larger combinatorial framework that unifies binomial coefficients, polynomial identities and
          classical integer sequences.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In summary, a simple Bernoulli process provides a common language between random experiments, security models and
        combinatorial mathematics.
